# My portfolio

Hi There ✌

I’m a professional and passionate Front-End Developer focused on efficiency and constant learning. Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in Full Stack Web, Mobile applications and everything in its orbit. I am fascinated by web and mobile programming, development and building. I am gaining knowledge and ideas working in this area. I am keen to gain more experience in the field. My goal is to build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

Therefore, I’m looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among its developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a pleasant and friendly addition to the team. I am, therefore currently looking for a job as Front-End or Full-Stack developer. I always want to learn more, do more, and be more. I’m also a firm believer that we should never settle. I’m hard-working, super curious, committed, passionate, self-taught, enthusiastic, and also a fast learner!

When I’m not in front of a computer screen, I’m probably watching movies, reading books, or crossing off another item on my bucket list. <br/>
